- 👋 Hi, I’m @LorenaVirlan
- 👀 I’m interested in digital marketing.
- 🌱 As an entrepreneur with a diverse background, I've spent the last three years in Germany exploring new opportunities and discovering my passion for digital marketing and e-commerce. Through hard work and determination, I became an Amazon seller and started my own candle business. Along the way, I recognized the importance of keeping up with the latest digital trends and enrolled in an online marketing course to further develop my skills. I'm proud to have been able to turn my interests into a thriving business and I'm excited about the endless possibilities for growth and innovation in the digital world.

- 💞️ I'm open to obtain a position in online marketing where my experience and skills will be utilized to increase brand visibility and drive customer engagement.
- 📫 I can be reached via email: virlalorena@yahoo.com
